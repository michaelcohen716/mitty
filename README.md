# Mitty 
*The remittance app built on Matic*

Mitty is built on Matic's Layer 2 plasma chain to enable cheap, frictionless Dai transfers anywhere in the world. 

Mitty is a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing the mobile app to be available *immediately* on iOS and Android. 

>Note: I only have the equipment to test downloading on Chrome via Android, but as of iOS 11.3 (pushed March, 2018), PWAs are compatible with both platforms.
